> This is the day that the Lord has made;
> let us rejoice and be glad in it. 
> *[Psalm 118:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+118%3A24&version=ESV)*

Happy Friday class! I hope your week is coming to a great end.
I hope the breath prayer this week continues to inspire you in acting out your faith. 

> *As the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without deeds is dead.*

Has any action you've taken this week helped to strengthen your faith?

On [Wednesday](../doers_of_the_word/), we discussed how our faith is evidenced by our deeds.
Today, we'll focus on the second way our faith is evidenced -- by our conduct.

> It takes many good deeds to build a reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.
> -- *Benjamin Franklin*

Why does the world not take Christians seriously?
It's primarily because we have a reputation crisis.
The good deeds we do get drowned out by the sins we commit while 
concurrently telling the world to abstain from the same.

Jesus scolds the Jews when he says:

>  You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
> *[Matthew 7:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207&version=ESV)*

Peter also reminds us that because we must publicly hold ourselves to a kingdom standard,
even when it is difficult because this is our primary witness to the world.

> 11 Dear friends, you are foreigners and strangers on this earth. 
> So I beg you not to surrender to those desires that fight against you. 
> 12 Always let others see you behaving properly, even though they may still accuse you of doing wrong. 
> Then on the day of judgment, they will honor God by telling the good things they saw you do.
> *[1 Peter 2:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A11-12&version=CEV)*

If we want the world to listen to our good news, we must first live it out.
When we read the [story of the woman caught in adultery in John 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A1-11&version=ESV),
we typically focus on either the woman or on her accusers.
When Jesus said, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her”,
how do you think it would have been received by the accusers if he himself had a reputation for being amoral and sinful?
He was able to rescue the woman and call for mercy because he was appealing from a position of moral authority.

If Christians want to be considered the moral authority in the world, it's not good enough to only expect our leaders
to be held to strict standards but rather we ourselves must also strive to be above reproach so that we are able to
lead when called upon to do so.

> For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy 
> for gain, 8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 9 He must hold firm to the trustworthy 
> word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.
> *[Titus 1:7-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1%3A7-9&version=ESV)*

As you look back on this past week, ask yourself, "How has my conduct reflected my faith and served as a witness for God?"

Grace and peace,
