Happy Monday morning class. As you start your week, I want to encourage you to practice the breath prayer throughout your day.

*As the body without the spirit is dead, 
so also faith without deeds is dead.*

In Hebrew, there is only one word for both faith and faithfulness ([אמונה](https://firmisrael.org/learn/meaning-of-amen-and-hebrew-word-faith/), pronounced eh-moo-nah) -- the two are inseparable. 
In our culture, we often associate faith with a type of mental ascent. 
Mental assent is a subtle form of self-deception, just one step removed from hypocrisy. 
It is believing something in your head but never committing to it in your heart. 
In the Hebrew culture, faith meant acting in accordance with your belief. 
Faith and faithfulness are the same thing. 
You cannot have one without the other.

This week, I'll bring  a few thoughts to help you think about how we can find one way to start putting our faith into action. 
As motivation, I encourage you to read [Hebrews chapter 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11&version=ESV) today. 
Many Bibles title this the "Faith" chapter when it should be aptly called, the "Faith in **Action**" chapter.
Each of the men and women mentioned in this chapter did not just have faith, but acted on it, and it was accredited to them by God as righteousness.

Remember that you are not alone. God fills us with his Spirit -- the breath that Jerry talked about yesterday in his [sermon](https://centralchurchofchrist.subspla.sh/hyvqqhc).
We don't need Luke Skywalker's force, we have something much, much more powerful.
Open yourself to the idea of **fully** relying on God because imitating him as dearly loved children requires this dependence ([Ephesians 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A1&version=ESV)).

The next few days we'll explore 3 concrete way by which our faith is evidenced.

- By deeds.
- By conduct.
- By speech.

What is one thing you can give up this week and replace it with something that intentionally puts your faith into action?

Grace and peace,
Cody
