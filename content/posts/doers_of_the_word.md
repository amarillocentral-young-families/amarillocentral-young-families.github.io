Happy Wednesday class!

As you go through your daily activities this week, continue practicing our breath prayer:

*As the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without deeds is dead.*

On [Monday](../faith_without_works_is_dead/), we fleshed out the relationship between faith and faithfulness and determined you cannot have one without the other.
Today, we'll explore how our faith is **evidenced by our deeds**.

> 22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 23 For if anyone is a hearer of 
> the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. 
> 24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. 25 But the one who 
> looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts,
> he will be blessed in his doing.
> *[James 1:22-25 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=ESV)*

One way we prevent faith from being a mental ascent is when we bring it to completion with our actions.
Believing God and taking him at his word is "counted to us as righteousness".
Abraham was called a friend of God because he not only believed him but responded to him with his actions.

>  22 You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; 23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. 24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 25 And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?

Throughout the creation story in [Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=ESV) we
hear a common refrain: "And God saw that it was good". God takes pride in his creation and that includes us.

Not only is God proud of us (his creation), but he trusts us to participate and partner with him in his work.
Let's take a fresh look at the parable of the talents to understand what God has entrusted us with and what he expects of us in return.

> 14 “For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. 
> 15 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. 
> Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made 
> five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received 
> the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 19 Now after a long time 
> the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five 
> talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; 
> here, I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.
> You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
> 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; 
> here, I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. 
> You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
> 24 He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, 
> reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, 
> and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ 26 But his master answered him, 
> ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 
> 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what 
> was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 
> 29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, 
> even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. 
> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
> *[Mathew 25:14-30 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A14-30&version=ESV)*

Think about *how much* the property owner entrusted to his servants.
A talent is equivalent to what a peasant would have earned in 15 years.
Most of us don't realize just how much God has entrusted us with.

The basic takeaway here is that God has entrusted us with the spiritual equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
God has granted us the ability to make a difference and change the world both as individuals and as the Church collectively.
God has not placed a burden on us but rather knows what we are capable of with his support and blessing.

The property owner in the parable above invited his servants who used what they were given to come and enter into
his joy. We please God when we partner with him to do his work. We not only bless others when we do good deeds,
but we too are blessed as trustworthy servants. Think about how God used Joseph, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednigo, 
and Jesus, all humble servants who were faithful in doing God's calling and were blessed richly for it.
These servants never feared either God or the world around them because they knew God was partnering with them.

The weeping and gnashing of teeth experienced by the wicked servant reflects less about the afterlife but rather the
loss of the joy his blessings could have brought him in the here and now.

Paul's motivation also comes from a love for God, not fear, as reflected in his second letter to the Corinthians.

> For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; 
> 15 and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
> *[2 Corinthians 5:14-15 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A14-15&version=ESV)*

When we do good works, we are God's ambassadors and God uses us to make his appeal to the world.

> 20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
> 21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
> *[2 Corinthians 5:20-21 (ESV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A20-21&version=ESV)*

Good deeds not only reflect our faith, but they also turn God's love into action.

What is one good deed you can do this week to reflect your faith and put God's love into action?
